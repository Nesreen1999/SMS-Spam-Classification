# SMS-Spam-Classification
In this project, We applied supervised learning (classification) algorithms.
We used a public [SMS Spam dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset/), which is not a purely clean dataset. 
The data consists of two different columns (features), such as context, and class. The column context is referring to SMS. 
The column class may take a value that can be either spam or ham corresponding to related SMS context.
